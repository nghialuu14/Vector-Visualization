Task 1:
Find and place the first seeding point (in one of the fields that have large total vector angle).
Generate streamline from that seeding point by looking for its largest gradient neighbor point (next point shouldn't be repeated 
and generate angle > 90 degree)

Task 2:
Try a different dataset (other than Bernard) and see if the codes work for different dataset.
