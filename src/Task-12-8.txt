Filter more and make streamlines look smoother by:
(1) Remove those seed points (starting points) that are very closed to each other, because they seem to have the same pattern.
(2) Find a good threshold for the angle between two vectors (maybe instead of going to the next neighbor point, we can take the average of many next points,
and find out the best vector that connects those two points). 
(3) Find a good stopping point, if the next point is very closed and does not have any use, stop tracing.
