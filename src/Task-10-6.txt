(1) place a seed at each sample and compute a streamline in both forward and backward direction. Order the points on the same streamline 
consistently along the forward flow direction like you did last week

(2) compute the change of the flow direction at each point along a streamline like you did two weeks ago. Add all these angles together to get a 
single angle value, which will be a real number (float or double). Assign this number to the seed point of this streamline

(3) output all these angle values in a VTK file using a similar format as the input (i.e., using the same header that tells the dimension and 
the number of points in the file as shown in the Bernard data set, but the data values are scalar rather than vectors)
