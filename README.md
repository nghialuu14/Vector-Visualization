Vector field visualization

Work with different vector fields and discovered how streamlines are generated in a three-dimensional space.

Program in C++ to generate vtk files and visualize using Paraview.

Study the applications of streamline to weather study, oil spill trajectories, aerodynamics around missiles, etc.
